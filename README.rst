=========================
Desir Redis Python Client
=========================
Attempt to make a minimalist redis python client. Redis commands are meta-generated based on the json commands description file "https://github.com/antirez/redis-doc/raw/master/commands.json" from redis repository. Documentation is also dynamically generated based on this file.

Plus some nice pythonic stuff that will soon come.
(message passing, iterator, dict, set and list transparent implementation)

Desir is a permutation of Redis of course and related to the desire of
antirez for 6379 (aka MERZ) http://antirez.com/print.php?postid=220

Install
=======

sudo python setup.py install

Pythonic sugar
==========

1. Iterator
--------

You can use object Counter from a Redis class instance as a unique counter across as
many process, thread, server you could potentially have providing they
can access the same redis instance/cluster.

>>> import desir
>>> r=desir.Redis()
>>> counter_name="counter" # the name of the counter is counter, meaning
>>> the key used inside redis is this name
>>> counter_seed=5 # intial value of the counter is 5
>>> c=r.Counter(counter_name,counter_seed)
>>> print "the initial value of the counter is", c
>>> for i in c:
...  print i
...  if i>10:
...   break
>>> print "the next value of the counter is", c.next()
 the initial value of the counter is 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
 10
 11
 the next value of the counter is 12
>>>

2. Connector
----------

A connector is an attempt to make a message passing interface similar
to the Erlang send / receive message passing functions.

A connector is defined by its name which is pointing internaly to a
redis list using the connector name as the key name inside redis.

Here is how it works:

On client "toto" you do this:

>>> import desir
>>> n=desir.Redis()
>>> c=n.Connector("toto",timeout=5)

On client "tata" you do the same:

>>> import desir
>>> n=desir.Redis()
>>> d=n.Connector("tata",timeout=5)

Note that the timeout defined when instanciating the connector is used
only when using the connector as an iterator. A value of 0 means
timeout is never reached.

Then let´s define on client "toto" an object to send to client
"tata". Note that you can send any serializable object (using pickle).

>>> v=[1,2,3,4,dict(a=2,b=3)]
>>> c.send("tata",v)
>>> c.send("tata",v)
>>> c.send("tata",v)

Now let´s go back to client "tata" and see the result:

>>> for v in d:
...  print v
... 
['toto', 1288551730.8449249, [1, 2, 3, 4, {'a': 2, 'b': 3}]]
['toto', 1288551730.8463399, [1, 2, 3, 4, {'a': 2, 'b': 3}]]
['toto', 1288551730.8468609, [1, 2, 3, 4, {'a': 2, 'b': 3}]]
>>> 

After 5 seconds, the for loop automatically stop trying to fetch
receive from the connector as timeout was defined as 5 (seconds).

You could also use d.receive() to get a result (blocking one) or
d.receive(timeout) for non blocking if timeout is not 0.

3. pub/sub
----------

To play with pub/sub:

>>> import desir
>>> r=desir.Redis()
>>> r.subscribe("foo")
['subscribe', 'foo', 1]
>>>
>>> for v in r.listen():
...  print(v)
...
['message', 'foo', 'tata']
['message', 'foo', 'toto']

>>> import desir
>>> def foo(p):
...  print "I have received %s" % (str(p))
...
>>> a=desir.SubAsync("foo",foo)

on another redis socket i do this:
publish foo toto
:2

and here what i get on the console:
>>> I have received ['message', 'foo', 'toto']
